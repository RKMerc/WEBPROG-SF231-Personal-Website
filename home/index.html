Education / Achievements
I am currently taking an undergraduate degree as part of my college education and I have also completed my education in high school (Junior/Senior)

The undergraduate degree that I am taking is BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) that is offered by APC.
IT Experience
I have done some light coding in the past both as a hobby/personal interest as well as some moderate coding for one of my research papers in the past. 
Hobbies & Interests
One of my main hobbies is to read and play video games. Reading provides me with much entertainment for times when I am either bored or have completed my tasks.
Gaming helps relax my mind as well as de-stress from work or studies and helps provide me with some insight as to how other games implement unique systems and 
game mechanics into their games. This experience is valuable to me both for social and professional improvements as I aspire to be a game developer as well as
allow me to see what is both popular and engaging for different kinds of people with regards to games.
Goals In Life / Dream
As mentioned before, I aspire to be a game developer. This is one of the steps that will help me achieve one of my main goals which is to setup my own game
development studio. This will allow me to have freedom to develop games as well as to have a gathering of like-minded people with regards to my goals.
