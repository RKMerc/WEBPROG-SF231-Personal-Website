Hobbies & Interests

Goals In Life / Dream

As mentioned before, I aspire to be a game developer. This is one of the steps that will help me achieve one of my main goals which is to setup my own game
development studio. This will allow me to have freedom to develop games as well as to have a gathering of like-minded people with regards to my goals.
development studio. This will allow me to have freedom to develop games as well as to have a gathering of like-minded people with regards to my goals. Another
goal of mine is to setup my own internet cafe. Lately, I developed an interest in building computer systems and that I find it really fascinating how each

of an internet cafe that I want to build in the future.
