      <div class="col-md bg-primary text-white">About Me: I am Rafael Kenneth A. Mercado. I am currently studying in Asia Pacific College with an interest in game design and game development.</div>
      <div class="col-md bg-dark text-white">Education / Achievements: I am currently taking an undergraduate degree as part of my college education and I have also completed my education in high school (Junior/Senior).</div>

      <div class="col-md bg-primary text-white">Course<br> As for my course, I am taking BSCS (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) that is offered by APC.</div>
      <div class="col-md bg-dark text-white">IT Experience<br> I have done some light coding in the past both as a hobby/personal interest as well as some moderate coding for one of my research papers in the past.</div>
      <div class="col-md bg-primary text-white">Hobbies and Interests<br> One of my main hobbies is to read and play video games. Reading provides me with much entertainment for times when I am either bored or have completed my tasks. Gaming helps relax my mind as well as de-stress from work or studies and helps provide me with some insight as to how other games implement unique systems and game mechanics into their games. This experience is valuable to me both for social and professional improvements as I aspire to be a game developer as well as allow me to see what is both popular and engaging for different kinds of people with regards to games.</div>
      <div class="col-md bg-dark text-white">Goals in Life / Dreams<br> As mentioned before, I aspire to be a game developer. This is one of the steps that will help me achieve one of my main goals which is to setup my own game development studio. Another goal of mine is to setup my own internet cafe. Lately, I developed an interest in building computer systems and that I find it really fascinating how each component plays a role in the entire build process, be it budget related or compatibility related. I also hold a fond memory of internet cafes as this was one of the times earlier in my life where I really enjoyed playing computer games as we did not own our own computer back then. Here is a link to one of the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tnccebu/">examples</a> of an internet cafe that I want to build in the future.</div>

 <li>Strategy</li>
 <li>RPG</li>
 <li>Puzzle</li>
 <li>Co-op</li>
 <li>Adventure</li>
</ol>
