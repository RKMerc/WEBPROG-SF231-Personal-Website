    <td>IT Experience</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hobbies & Interests</td>
    <td>One of my main hobbies is to read and play video games. Reading provides me with much entertainment for times when I am either bored or have completed my tasks. 
      Gaming helps relax my mind as well as de-stress from work or studies and helps provide me with some insight as to how other games implement unique systems and game
      mechanics into their games. This experience is valuable to me both for social and professional improvements as I aspire to be a game developer as well as allow me to
      see what is both popular and engaging for different kinds of people with regards to games.

    <td>Goals In Life / Dream</td>
    <td>As mentioned before, I aspire to be a game developer. This is one of the steps that will help me achieve one of my main goals which is to setup my own game
    development studio. This will allow me to have freedom to develop games as well as to have a gathering of like-minded people with regards to my goals. Another
    goal of mine is to setup my own internet cafe. Lately, I developed an interest in building computer systems and that I find it really fascinating how each 
    component plays a role in the entire build process, be it budget related or compatibility related. I also hold a fond memory of internet cafes as this was one
    of the times earlier in my life where I really enjoyed playing computer games as we did not own our own computer back then. Attached below is one of the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tnccebu/">examples</a>
    of an internet cafe that I want to build in the future.</td>
